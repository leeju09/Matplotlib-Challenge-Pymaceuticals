# Matplotlib-Challenge-Pymaceuticals

I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc. a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior Data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens/ Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked me for a top-level summary of the study results.

As a Data Analyst some of the skills demonstrated:

	*Navigate Matplotlib's PyPlot interface.

	*Create line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots with Matplotlib.

	*Identify basic plot configuration options, such as xlim and ylim, with Matplotlib.

	*Create plots by using the DataFrame.plot() method.

	*Use Pandas to analyze a complex dataset and chart the corresponding visualizations.

	*Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, by using Python.

	*Plot, characterize, and quantify a normally distributed dataset with Python.

	*Qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential outliers in a dataset.

	*Define and quantify correlation between two factors.

	*Calculate and plot a linear regression with Python.

# ** Final summary Analysis

From the data that was collected and put into detail graphs, there was a few things to note about the tumors, gender and the different types of treatment of drugs.
    - Capomulin and Ramincane are on par with each other from their mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error. While the other drugs varies.
    - Infubinol and Ceftamin doesn't appear to be successful in tumor reduction as Capomulin and Ramicane treatment.
    - Capomulin Treatment R554, in the 40+ days of treatment we can see a drastic drop of the tumor volume.
	

** Resources that was used to complete this homework was in class lessons and activity that was given and done in class. Googling python codes and using Xpert Learning Assistant and chatGPT.**
